description: "In this project, we explore existing data from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at the University of Michigan to understand how individuals unable to afford a formal education perform in these courses as compared to those able to afford formal education. I plan to extend the results of the quantitative data and conduct semi-structured interviews to understand if and how MOOCs are being used to increase employment opportunities."
