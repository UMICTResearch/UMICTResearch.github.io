- name: "Coding Bias in the Use of Behavior Management Technologies: Uncovering Socio-technical Consequences of Data-driven Surveillance in Classrooms"
  pic: Lu_DIS21_thumb
  abstract: "Digital educational technologies have been employed in classrooms
to collect students’ behavioral data in the hope of supporting teachers in identifying and correcting undesirable behaviors, which raises
the concern of heightened surveillance in classrooms. We present a
qualitative study of 20 K-8 teachers to understand their experiences
and practices of using ClassDojo, a data-driven classroom behavior
management intervention. Our analysis reveals a series of unintended socio-technical effects resulting from the use of ClassDojo in
practice. In particular, the use of ClassDojo runs the risk of measuring, codifying, and simplifying the nuanced psycho-social factors
that may drive children’s behavior and performance, thereby serving as a “Band-Aid” for deeper issues. We discuss how this process
could perpetuate existing inequality and bias in education. With the
goals of spurring future design and mitigating these unintended effects, we take on the reflexive-interventionist approach and propose
three considerations for designing and using future educational
technologies: 1) provide context, 2) expose bias, and 3) challenge
and reimagine what is normal"

- name: "Eliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults: A Case Study of Remote Speculative Co-Design"

  abstract: "The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation has become a topic of conversation across HCI,
CSCW, and other computing communities. This conversation has
grave implications for communities that often fnd themselves an
afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could
beneft most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring”
through co-designed speculative design fctions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined
technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a
Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes
and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures
and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden
with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways
that speculative design fctions and futuring can serve to address
inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely
with historically excluded populations."

- name:  "Learning for the Rise of China': Exploring Uses and Gratifications of State-Owned Online Platform"

  abstract: "In January 2019, the Chinese Communist Party launched the online platform XueXi QiangGuo, which translates
into “Learning for the Rise of China.” Within two months, XueXi became the top-downloaded item of the
month on Apple’s App Store in China. In response, we conducted an interview study with 28 active XueXi
users to investigate their uses and gratifications of this state-owned online platform. Our results reveal seven
key motivations: compliance, self-status seeking, general information seeking, job support, entertainment,
patriotism, and learning. This state-owned platform introduced a new model for official information dissemination and political communication through direct surveillance and monitoring, leveraging and fostering
emotional attachment, and offering heterogeneous apolitical content. We discuss the intended and unintended
ramifications of these components, highlighting the importance of future CSCW research to critically engage
with pluralist political narratives situated in varied societies, especially non-Western democracies."
